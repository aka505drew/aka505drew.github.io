    <div><h2>This Is A Replay Of AKA<h2></div>

        <div><p>I'm a drug to this grudge and it's with my covenant, I'll plug a bitch,
        Lovin' this mug is what the ruckus is, psycho thug with it,
        Falling down like Micheal Douglas with the ruggishness,
        Addadimean, they wonderin' why did I bring this side of my dream,
        The Nina's a horror machine, dolla for dolla, I balla for all'a my green,
        Nigga, my name is Inigo Montoya, I got a evil plan for ya,
        And you're about to get dropped, this box is worse than pandora,
        (Hahahahaha) They're gonna laugh at you, 'cause I had to
        do what I had to dO Went tap on you like Shap'll do,
        Beatin' 'em up and shootin' 'em up then stab a few,
        Sad ya knew that you had your crew and they ass are through,
        I'm killin' 'em and throwin' 'em back at you</p>
      </div>

      <div><h2>This Is A Replay Of Change<h2></div>
        <div><p> Can't a brother get a little peace?
              There's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East.
              Instead of war on poverty,
              they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.
              And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do.
              But now I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you.
              Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp smack you up.
              You gotta learn to hold ya own.
              They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.
              But tell the cops they can't touch this.
              I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this.
              That's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool.
              And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped and I never get to lay back.
              'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback.
              Some buck that I roughed up way back... comin' back after all these years.
              Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is</p></div>

      <div><h2>This Is A Replay Of Life</h2></div>
      <p>Being a father has been, without a doubt, my greatest source of
         achievement, pride and inspiration. Fatherhood has taught me about
         unconditional love, reinforced the importance of giving back and taught
         me how to be a better person.Read more at.......I started off with
         a company, InfoSpace, with my own funding. The company was listed
         among the most successful companies and I went on to start Intelius
         and Moon Express. Now, I focus my time on using the skills of an
         entrepreneur to solve many of the grand challenges facing us in the
         areas of education, healthcare, clean water and energy.

            In a trip that shitted with three, one, two, seven, six, two, ten
            Three line connection, as the rest of them wanted affection
            Just bring the bead, we got the drinks you need
